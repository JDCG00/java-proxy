## Getting Started

Java proxy server that forwards requests to a target server. The target server is specified in the configuration file. The proxy server listens on a specified port and forwards requests to the target server. The proxy server should be able to handle multiple requests concurrently.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
